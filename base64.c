  // In 3 bytes (really, 3 "octets") there are __4__ sextets.
  // You can see that from the diagram above. byte0 (0000 0011) contains
  // the first sextet (AAAA AA) and 2 bits of the 2nd sextet (BB).
  // byte1 contains the next 4 bits of the 2nd sextet (BBBB) and 4 bits
  // of the 3rd sextet (CCCC). byte2 has 2 bits of the 3rd sextet and
  // all 6 bits of the 4th sextet.
  //
  // You can see why we process in groups of 3 bytes: because 3*8 = 24
  // and 24 is the lowest common multiple between 6 and 8. To divide
  // a group of bytes EVENLY into groups of 6, the number of bytes has to
  // be a multiple of 3.
  
  // Talking in bits, the input already HAS to be a multiple of 8 (because you just
  // can't have anything smaller than a byte saved to memory or disk on modern
  // computers). To successfully convert the bitstream into groups of 6 bits, we'll force
  // the input bitstream to being a MULTIPLE OF 24, so that it will evenly
  // divide by 6.
  
  // For that reason, we have the concept of PADDING: if the original octet
  // stream is NOT a multiple of 3, then we pad it with 1 or 2 extra bytes
  // so that it is a multiple of 3.
  
  // So without further ado let's extract the 4 sextets from the 3 octets!

  // We want to shift the first 6 bits in the above diagram down to sitting
  // flushed to the right. So we want bin[0] (containing AAAA AABB) to just
  // become 00AA AAAA. We do that with a shift right of 2 bits.
  
  // We take the number that comes out of that and immediately convert it to
  // the base64 character for that number by doing a direct lookup into the
  // b64 encoding array.
